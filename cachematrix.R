## R Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping--caching the inverse of a matrix

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix",
## which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
